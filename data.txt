Internship Test

For Freshers: NodeJS Developer Profile
Instructions:
You have to create this webpage hodlinfo.com by using HTML and CSS and backend using node js.


Fetch top 10 results from API(https://api.wazirx.com/api/v2/tickers) in your Nodejs express server and store name, last, buy, Sell, volume, base_unit of all top 10 results in the database (you can use any database(Preferable PostgreSQL)).
Then create a route using express to get the above stored data from the database to the frontend.
Please follow the above two points exactly as mentioned because the result of the test is dependent on it.
Tip: Use a snip tool for images.
Do remember that the webpage you build should be identical to almost 90% with the link shared in the first instruction.
